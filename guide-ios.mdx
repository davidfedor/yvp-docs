## Installing the SDK

1. Register your app with YouVersion Platform, and acquire an app_id. 

2. In your Xcode project, on the File menu, choose "Add Package Dependencies".

3. Type `https://github.com/youversion/yvpsdk-swift.git` into the search field.

4. Select `yvpsdk-swift` from the search results.

5. For the "Dependency Rule", select `Up to Next Major Version`. 

6. Ensure your project is selected next to `Add to Project`.

7. Click `Add Package`.

8. On the Package Products dialog, add `YouVersionPlatform` to your target and click `Add Package`.

## Displaying a Bible Verse

Create an init() function for your app if you don't already have one, and specify your app key there, like this:

```
import YouVersionPlatform

@main
struct yourApp: App {
    init() {
        YouVersionPlatform.configure(appKey: "YOUR_APP_KEY_HERE")
    }
    var body: some Scene {...
```

And now to display a single verse or verse range, this is all it takes:

```
import YouVersionPlatform

struct DemoView: View {
    @StateObject private var version: BibleVersion
    
    init () {
        _version = StateObject(wrappedValue: BibleVersion(111).readied())
    }

    var body: some View {
        if let ref = version.usfm("JHN.3.16-17") {
            BibleTextView(ref)
        }
    }
}
```

If you're displaying a longer passage of scripture than a single verse, you should wrap BibleTextView inside a normal SwiftUI ScrollView.
